## Installation
This project uses the serverless framework. For more information about serverless and how to install it, visit their [website](https://www.serverless.com/).

## Ideas for future development
- Add support for translating into languages other than English (possibly based on the user's own language code)
- Allow users to specify or hint at the language of the text they are translating
- Allow for transliterated inputs
